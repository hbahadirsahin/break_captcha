# Break Captcha

Yet another old project code. 

The training and test data generation is built-in (if i recall correctly, depending on the size, the generation process may take up a long time). 
The model is based on usual CNN layers with local response normalizer. Luckily, I still have my project report, so one can quickly check it for the model details and results.  

As a final note, one needs to manually adjust the model path to evaluate the trained path.
